### Hi there ☕️☕️☕️

I'm a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science. I'm currently focused on mastering the fundamentals like 
Computer Systems programming, Networking, Algorithms, and more. 

In the future, I plan to study broadly across Data Science disciplines line Computational Linguistics (NLP), Computer Vision, and Artificial 
Intelligence, before finally picking an area to specialize.

That's the plan anyway!
