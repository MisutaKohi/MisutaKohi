### Hi, I'm Ryan! 👋

I'm a full stack software engineer with an interest in large-scale systems ⚙️, entrepreneurship 💼, espresso ☕️, and making the world 🌎 a better place.

As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, I'm studying Computer Science as a part of Penn's MCIT program. When I finish this program in August 2024, I'll be heading straight into a new one as a part of Penn's Master of Science in Engineering.
